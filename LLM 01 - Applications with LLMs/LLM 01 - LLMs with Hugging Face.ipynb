    "\n",
    "You may see parameters like `num_beams`, `do_sample`, etc. specified in Hugging Face pipelines.  These are inference configurations.\n",
    "\n",
    "LLMs work by predicting (generating) the next token, then the next, and so on.  The goal is to generate a high probability sequence of tokens, which is essentially a search through the (enormous) space of potential sequences.\n",
    "\n",
    "To do this search, LLMs use one of two main methods:\n",
    "* **Search**: Given the tokens generated so far, pick the next most likely token in a \"search.\"\n",
    "   * **Greedy search** (default): Pick the single next most likely token in a greedy search.\n",
    "   * **Beam search**: Greedy search can be extended via beam search, which searches down several sequence paths, via the parameter `num_beams`.\n",
    "* **Sampling**: Given the tokens generated so far, pick the next token by sampling from the predicted distribution of tokens.\n",
    "   * **Top-K sampling**: The parameter `top_k` modifies sampling by limiting it to the `k` most likely tokens.\n",
    "   * **Top-p sampling**: The parameter `top_p` modifies sampling by limiting it to the most likely tokens up to probability mass `p`.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can toggle between search and sampling via parameter `do_sample`.\n",
    "\n",
    "For more background on search and sampling, see [this Hugging Face blog post](https://huggingface.co/blog/how-to-generate).\n",
    "\n",
